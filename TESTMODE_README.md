Your GOATY app is currently running in **Test Mode** - no blockchain deployments needed!

## ✅ What's Working Right Now

You have a **fully functional** credit purchase system that simulates the entire blockchain transaction flow:

### User Experience
1. **Connect Wallet** - Works with Phantom (Solana) or MetaMask (Base)
2. **Buy Credits** - Full purchase flow with simulated blockchain transactions
3. **Progress Tracking** - See approval → purchase → verification steps
4. **Instant Credits** - Credits added to your account immediately
5. **Transaction History** - All purchases recorded in database
6. **Play Games** - Use credits to play GOAT Rush

### What's Simulated
- ✨ USDC approval transactions (Base)
- ✨ Credit purchase transactions
- ✨ Blockchain confirmations
- ✨ Transaction hashes
- ✨ On-chain verification

### What's Real
- ✅ Database storage
- ✅ Credit management
- ✅ User balances
- ✅ Game logic
- ✅ Voucher claims
- ✅ Full UI/UX

## 🎯 Perfect For

- **Development & Testing** - Test the full user flow without blockchain costs
- **UI/UX Refinement** - Perfect the experience before going live
- **Demo & Showcase** - Show investors/users the complete flow
- **Feature Development** - Build additional features without blockchain dependency

## 💡 How to Identify Test Mode

Look for these indicators:
- Yellow "TEST" badge on the purchase button
- "Test Mode" label in the purchase dialog
- "Simulation Mode Active" notice with lightning bolt icon
- Progress messages say "Simulating..."

## 🚀 When You're Ready for Production

Follow these simple steps:

### Option 1: Quick Switch (Recommended)
If you just want to go live without deploying contracts yourself:

1. Contact Lovable support or a blockchain developer
2. They deploy the contracts for you
3. Get the contract addresses
4. Update one file: `src/lib/contractConfig.ts`
   - Set `TEST_MODE = false`
   - Add contract addresses
5. Done! Your app now uses real blockchain transactions

### Option 2: Deploy Yourself
See `DEPLOYMENT.md` and `SWITCHING_TO_PRODUCTION.md` for full instructions.

## 🎪 Try It Out!

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
   - Click "Connect Wallet"

   - Track your progress

## 🔧 Technical Details

### How Test Mode Works

```typescript
// src/lib/contractConfig.ts
export const TEST_MODE = true; // Toggle this to switch modes

// When TEST_MODE is true:
- Simulates blockchain delays (1-4 seconds)
- Generates realistic transaction hashes
- Records everything in database
- No actual blockchain calls made
- No gas fees required
- No USDC needed

// When TEST_MODE is false:
- Real smart contract interactions
- Actual blockchain transactions
- Real gas fees apply
- Real USDC required
```

### What Gets Stored

Even in test mode, these are stored in your database:
- Purchase records with simulated tx hashes
- Updated user credit balances
- Transaction timestamps
- Session tracking

This means when you switch to production, your database structure is already battle-tested!

## 📊 Monitoring Test Purchases

Check your Supabase database:

```sql
-- View all test purchases
SELECT * FROM purchases 
WHERE session_id LIKE 'SIMULATED-%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check user credits
SELECT wallet_address, credits, points, streak 
FROM users 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No Real Money** - Test mode doesn't involve real cryptocurrency
2. **Fully Functional** - All features work exactly as they will in production
3. **Data Persists** - All test data stays in your database
4. **Easy Switch** - Toggle test mode on/off anytime
5. **Zero Risk** - Can't lose money or mess up blockchain state

## 🎉 Benefits of Test Mode

- **No Setup Needed** - Start testing immediately
- **Zero Cost** - No gas fees, no USDC required
- **Fast Iteration** - Test changes without blockchain delays
- **Safe Environment** - Can't break anything
- **Real Data Flow** - Database and backend work exactly as production
